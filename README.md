## 🏆 Project Description

The Student Grade Management System is a Java console-based application designed to manage student academic records. It allows users to input student details such as ID, name, and marks in three subjects. The program calculates the total percentage and assigns a grade based on the average score. All student records are saved to a local file (`students.txt`) for persistent storage.

The project demonstrates core Java concepts such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- Runtime Polymorphism
- Console I/O

This project is ideal for beginners to understand how real-world Java applications handle data processing, object interaction, and file persistence.
